            <p>Lviv architects and experts spoke about the little-known buildings that they consider to be the most beautiful.</p>
            <h2 id="olga-kryvoruchko-architect">Olga Kryvoruchko, architect</h2>
            <p>I would single out a building on Saksaganskogo Street, 6. A beautiful construction house built in 1938 by the design of Adam Kurillo and Zbigniew Vardzala, on whose main facade there is a barely perceptible undulations - the wall is not parallel to the street, but goes along a curve. It's interesting and atypical of constructivism, reminiscent of architecture half a century later by Frank Gary.</p>
              <blockquote>
            <p>Also very interesting staircase with radial steps, elevator, interesting location of apartments. The staircase is illuminated as if through a glazed crack in the wall - a good reception. However, now the gap is laid glass blocks, as if the light was too much. This is a home with lots of well-crafted details. It is a pity that he is in a deplorable condition, as in the end, most homes without their owners (I do not think that the residents of the apartments are aware of the owners of the extra space). Simple and beautiful architecture, without decor in the traditional sense - there is no stucco, cornices and arches, but very elegant.</p>
