            <p>Lviv architects and experts spoke about the little-known buildings that they consider to be the most beautiful.</p>
            <h2 id="olga-kryvoruchko-architect">Olga Kryvoruchko, architect</h2>
            <p>I would single out a building on Saksaganskogo Street, 6. A beautiful construction house built in 1938 by the design of Adam Kurillo and Zbigniew Vardzala, on whose main facade there is a barely perceptible undulations - the wall is not parallel to the street, but goes along a curve. It's interesting and atypical of constructivism, reminiscent of architecture half a century later by Frank Gary.</p>
              <blockquote>
            <p>Also very interesting staircase with radial steps, elevator, interesting location of apartments. The staircase is illuminated as if through a glazed crack in the wall - a good reception. However, now the gap is laid glass blocks, as if the light was too much. This is a home with lots of well-crafted details. It is a pity that he is in a deplorable condition, as in the end, most homes without their owners (I do not think that the residents of the apartments are aware of the owners of the extra space). Simple and beautiful architecture, without decor in the traditional sense - there is no stucco, cornices and arches, but very elegant.</p>

            <p>Cats have a high breeding rate.[8] Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree
                pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering and the abandonment
                of former household pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.[9]
                In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other
                factors, to the extinction of many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within
                specific regions and may have contributed to the extinction of isolated island populations.[10] Cats are
                thought to be primarily, though not solely, responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the
                presence of feral and free ranging cats makes some locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction
                in otherwise suitable locations.[11] Stephen J. O'Brien argues that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV),
                a disease not so different from HIV was found in house cats. Interestingly, over eight free-ranging wild
                species of Felidae are infected with their own species-specific FIV strain (based on FIV gene sequence monophyly)
                that in most cases seems to be attenuated by historic selection of genetically resistant survivors in today's
                wild places.[12] Since cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated
                there,[13] but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500
                years ago (7,500 BC).[14] A genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern
                wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in West Asia.[13][15] A 2016 study found that leopard cats were
                undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated
                cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today.[16][17]</p>
            <h2 id="popularity">Popularity</h2>
            <p>As of a 2007 study, cats are the second most popular pet in the US by number of pets owned, behind freshwater
                fish.[18] In a 2010 study they were ranked the third most popular pet in the UK, after fish and dogs, with
                around 8 million being owned.</p>
