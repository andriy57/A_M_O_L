  <h1>Alexander Savelyev, founder of the Design Bureau “Comfort Workshop”</h1>
  <p>In Lviv, I have areas where every building is a favorite. For example, Lviv Montmartre - who knows about him? This is a complex of buildings of the Holy Mountain, which overlooks Lviv. There is its own Sacre Coeur - St. George's Cathedral, and a bohemian area of ​​mansions of artists and architects of the XIX century.
    An interesting house of artist Novakovsky, built by [Julian] Zakharevich. It was a unique architect. He was able to combine what we, modern Lviv architects, cannot unite now - he not only designed, but also invested, which enabled him to think not in a separate building, but in creating new vectors of the city’s development. He created progressive ideas of the garden city. Such was the cottage village of the late 19th century, where already appeared tram tracks along Chuprinka were taken into account. The perfect balance in the combination of low private villas and storey buildings with tenement houses. Kastelivka branches off from the mountain - an entire area designed by him on this principle.
    What we still lack is a sense of financial freedom in the design. It’s like an artist who draws not by order, but by inspiration. Zakharevich conceived and built the area, not being squeezed by financial clutches. Without limiting yourself to the tastes of customers. Dictating new directions, experimenting, focusing on your taste. And these houses found buyers.</p>
